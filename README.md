# Loopback ACL Bug Test

This project is a minimum viable test case for Loopback.io issue [#1645](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback/issues/1645)

## How to run this test

First, do the obvious. Clone this repository, install Loopback if you haven't already (`npm install -g strongloop`),
and install this repo's dependencies (`npm install`). This example uses a MySQL database, so you'll need to set one up.
Because this is quick and dirty, we're using `root` with no password on our local machine. Don't do this in production.
Please. For the love of god.
